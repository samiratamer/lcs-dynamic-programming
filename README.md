# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) – Dynamic Programming

A C program that finds the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming.

## Problem
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both. A subsequence appears in the same relative order but not necessarily consecutively.

## Example
Input:  X = "AGGTAB", Y = "GXTXAYB"
Output: LCS length = 4, LCS = "GTAB"

## Concepts Used
- Dynamic programming (bottom-up approach)
- 2D DP table for memoization
- Backtracking to reconstruct the sequence
